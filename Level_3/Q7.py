"""Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing
the names of students and their corresponding subjects.
The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects.
Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.

[Commerce, Science, Computer]
Output: [Sam: Commerce, Alice: Science , Mona: Computer]"""
